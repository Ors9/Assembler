# Custom Assembler Project
## Overview

This project is an assembler for a custom, human-invented assembly language. The assembler translates custom assembly instructions into machine code, providing an educational tool for learning about low-level programming and assembly language design.

## Features

- **Custom Instruction Set**: Supports unique instructions like `LOAD`, `STORE`, `ADD`, `SUB`, `PRN`, `JSR`, and more, specific to this custom language.
- **Data Handling**: Supports data definitions with `.data` and `.string` directives for initializing memory.
- **Error Checking**: Includes syntax and semantic error checking to help users identify issues in their code.
- **Output Formats**: Generates output in multiple formats, including object code (`.ob`), entry point list (`.ent`), and external references (`.ext`).
